## Problem Background
When creating a new Power BI from scratch it does not contain a theme that can be used in dashboards.
This will result in not being able to select a theme when being pinned to dashboards.

When not being able to select theme from a report it will not show up in the same colors as seen in the report.
Below is an example of tile color without theme in report.

What we want is a tile that is white like the one below:

Make sure to do it in both Wallpaper and Report page.
